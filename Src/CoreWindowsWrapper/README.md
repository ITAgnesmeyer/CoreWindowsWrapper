# CoreWindowsWrapper
### Native Windows Wrapper for .NET-Core and .Framework

CoreWindowsWrapper is a DLL you can use to create Core Applications showing Dialogs without using System.Windows.Forms.
The Project uses the Windows - API to create Native Windows. I personally use this DLL to create Copy-Deploy-Setups.

The component does not use COM. Unlike WPF or Windows Forms, it is possible to compile AOT Native.
